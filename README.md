Workflow

1. User enters a destination through voice or text input.
2. Frontend sends the request to the FastAPI backend.
3. Navigation Engine generates route instructions.
4. Voice Service converts instructions into speech.
5. YOLOv8 detects nearby obstacles using camera input.
6. Haptic and audio alerts notify the user of hazards.
7. Emergency module can be activated when assistance is required.
